## About

By combining elements of modern pop with traditional training from professional teams overseas we aim to convey to audiences the exciting art of diabolo.

We have performed in and around the Seattle area as well as Richmond Night Market in Canada.

Whether you are looking for the next showstopper at your event, lessons for your children or students, or are interested in joining our team, please reach out to us through a Facebook message or email!
