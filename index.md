Vertax was Florida's 1<sup>st</sup> college-level diabolo performance group that performed at various student-led events and talent shows across the state.

Our last performance was in the fall of 2019. After 5 years of fun, circumstances such as graduating members and the COVID-19 pandemic brought our journey to an end.
